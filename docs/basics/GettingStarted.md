# Getting Started

Getting up and running with the scaffold is pretty simple, simply execute the following commands one after the other.

```sh
# Install and use the required NodeJS version of this project.
nvm install

# Install the all dependencies of the project.
yarn install

# Setup the project.
yarn run bootstrap

# Start the development server.
yarn run dev
```

The development server takes around 10 seconds to fully start, once this is done, your OS's default browser should open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you should be able to view the universal application being rendered on both the server and the client.
