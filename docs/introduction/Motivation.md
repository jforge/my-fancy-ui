# Motivation

There are a lot of boilerplates and `create-*` packages which evolve around the React ecosystem. But none of them really scaled to an enterprise company with many teams / developers that well. With `create-react-microservice` our goal is to provide a scaffold for React projects which will scale well, embrace the code sharing mentality between teams as well as provide a solid test setup and best-practices out of the box.

It's a result out of many years of experience of working with React and Redux in many environments and companies. Like many other scaffolds, it is opinionated and might not be aimed at smaller businesses or applications. In case something is missing, please feel free to create an issue and we will implement it or add a guide on how to solve your problem in the official docs.

And remember, pull requests are always welcome. :-)
